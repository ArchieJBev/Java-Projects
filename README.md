I have made classes to represent complex numbers, polynomials with complex coefficients.
The secant java file is a method for finding the root(s) of a polynomail (using the secant method). 
Then the remaining file will produce an image of a fractal which shows areas of the complex plane that converge or diverge to a root if you use that complex number as the initial value in the iteration.
